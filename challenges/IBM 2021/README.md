# IBM Quantum Challenge 2021
This folder contains the solved notebooks for all 5 exercises of the IBM Quantum Challenge 2021. Additionaly, inside each folder you can find a `solution.ipynb` file which contains **only** the solution, with the steps that I took to arrive to it. I decided to make this separate files for the solutions since the tutorial part of each notebook took a big part of them. Therefore, having the solutions by themselves makes them easier to follow. I also ensured that each `solution.ipynb` file contains everything needed to run (e.g., imports and helper functions) and understand my code; however, some prerequisites may be included in the problem notebook â€” I've tried to point out when this happens.
