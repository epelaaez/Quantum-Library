# Bell State
This circuit creates the bell state (|00> and |11>)/sqrt(2). The circuit is composed the following way:

And here is an histogram obtained from measuring the two qubits into classical bits. We can see that there was a 50-50 chance of getting either |00> or |11> (without considering noise from the quantum computer).
