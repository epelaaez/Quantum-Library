# Teleportation Protocol
The quantum teleportation protocol is a fundamental part of many quantum algorithms. It enables you to transfer the state of one qubit to another qubit instantly. An important distinction to make is that teleportation in this context refers to the transfer of information rather than matter, since the qubits stay in the same place, but the state is transferred.

This protocol is useful to overcome the difficulties imposed by the [no-cloning theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem), which tells us that it is not possible to create an exact copy of a quantum state. Which means we cannot copy the state of one qubit into another, but we can teleport it. In fact, most uses of the teleportation protocol are to transfer the state of a qubit into another within a single QPU rather than across large distances like most sci-fi movies portray it.
