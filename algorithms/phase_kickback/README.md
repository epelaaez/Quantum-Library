# Phase kickback
Phase kickback is a fundamental building block of larger quantum circuit. As you may imagine, this circuit by itself may not have a lot of practical uses, but when incorporated into a larger algorithm, it turns out to be very useful. If you want to get a deeper explanation, I recommend looking at this [answer in Quora](https://qr.ae/pNZ46i) by Pranav Gokhale. 

First, let's take a look at how the circuit we implemented looks like:

**TODO: explain circuit**

Our resulting statevector is the following:
