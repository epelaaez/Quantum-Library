# QuantumCircuits
Implementation of quantum circuits using Qiskit. This repository contains important circuits used in quantum computing. I will be adding circuits while I learn them, so the implementations or descriptions may not be completely correct at all times. But I will make sure to correct anything as soon as I notice it. 

If you want to run a certain circuit without downloading the whole `algorithms` module, make sure to include these imports at the top of your file instead of the single import given.
```python
from os.path import join
from qiskit import *
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram, circuit_drawer, plot_bloch_multivector
```
